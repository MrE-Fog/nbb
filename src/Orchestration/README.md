# process manager packages
##### we need two packages, one for building the definitions, using a fluent api, and the sencond one is the runtime, which runs those definitions


## The packages
  - [`NBB.ProcessManager.Definition`](./NBB.ProcessManager.Definition#process-manager-definition) - definition builder
  - [`NBB.ProcessManager.Runtime`](./NBB.ProcessManager.Runtime#process-manager-runtime) - a runtime processor
